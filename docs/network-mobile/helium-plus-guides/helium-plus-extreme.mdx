# Extreme - ExtremeCloud IQ - Passpoint Configuration

This guide describes how to set up and test your Extreme environment so you can use it with Helium
Passpoint service.

---

## Prerequisites

- Extreme system must be running ExtremeCloud IQ.
- Guide assumes the network is using an on-prem Extreme controller.
- Extreme system has AP(s) linked to the controller.
- Extreme system has basic traffic routing working with existing SSID(s).
- An Intel-based host is required in the network to run the RadSecProxy container.
- RadSecProxy must be deployed and running before configuring Extreme. For deployment instructions,
  see [RadSecProxy Deployment](#deploy-radsecproxy-container).

---

## High-Level Steps

1. Deploy RadSecProxy container and record the IP address of the host
2. Configure the Wireless LAN (SSID and RADIUS servers)
3. Configure Hotspot 2.0
4. Deploy configuration to access points
5. Test Passpoint connectivity

---

## Deploy RadSecProxy Container

RADIUS messages used to authenticate users and for session accounting are transmitted unsecured and
over UDP by default. By directing these messages internally in your secure network to a RadSecProxy,
the UDP is then converted to a TLS protected TCP connection to the Helium Network core AAA servers.

### RadSecProxy Prerequisites

- An Intel-based machine with Docker installed.
- The Intel-based machine has a private IP in your network reachable from your Extreme controller.
- ACLs or Firewalls allow Extreme controller and Docker container to communicate UDP on port 1812
  and 1813.
- ACLs or Firewalls allow container/host to reach the internet on TCP ports 2083 and 3802.

### RadSecProxy Container Deployment

1. Un-zip and untar the `Helium_RadSec_Docker.tar.gz` file into a directory of your choice on the
   host machine. This will unpack:
   - `Dockerfile` - The docker instructions to build the container
   - `Radsecproxy.conf` - Pre-populated to connect to Helium Network AAA servers
   - `docker-compose.yml` - File to start and stop the container as a daemon

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf Helium_RadSec_Docker.tar.gz
   ```

2. Into the same directory, copy the 3 certificates obtained from Helium Network:
   - `ca.pem` - The root CA certificate
   - `cert.pem` - The user certificate
   - `key.pem` - The key file matched to the certificate

3. Start the container using:

   ```bash
   sudo docker compose up -d
   ```

4. To stop the container:

   ```bash
   sudo docker compose down
   ```

5. Record the private IP address of the RadSecProxy host machine. You'll use this IP when
   configuring RADIUS servers in your Extreme controller.

## Log in to the ExtremeCloud IQ Dashboard

To start the configuration process, log in to the ExtremeCloud IQ Dashboard as admin. For existing
environments with additional users, log in as a user with administrative privileges.

The ExtremeCloud IQ Dashboard appears. Your access points are displayed.

> **Note:** There are a number of options you can set. Only the options that require your input are
> shown. Default values are used for options that don't need adjustment.

    style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }}
    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
</figure>
<br />
6. Enter an **SSID Name** for internal purposes, such as `Helium`, and a **Broadcast Name** that
your clients will see. The names can be the same.

7. For **SSID Usage**, select **Enterprise**. (The default is Private Pre-Shared Key.) In the **Key
   Management** field, select **WPA3-802.1X** and as **Encryption Method** choose **CCMP (AES)**.

### Add RadSec Authentication Servers to the Network Policy

Your Extreme controller will communicate with the RadSecProxy instance you deployed, which securely
proxies RADIUS traffic to Helium using TLS. Ensure you have the private IP address or hostname of
your RadSecProxy host from the [deployment step](#deploy-radsecproxy-container).

To add RadSec authentication servers to your network policy, you create a server group and then add
servers to the group. Ensure your Extreme controller supports RadSec (RADIUS over TLS).

1. Still on the **Wireless Networks** page, scroll down to **Authentication Settings**.
2. Under **Authenticate via RADIUS Server**, click **+** to add a RADIUS server group. The
   **Configure RADIUS Servers** dialog box appears.
3. Enter a **RADIUS Server Group Name**, such as `Helium_radsec_group`.
4. Click **Settings** to the right of the server group description. The **Select RADIUS Settings**
   dialog box appears.
5. Change the **Accounting interim update interval** to `300` (seconds).
6. Click **Save RADIUS Settings** on the bottom right. You return to the Configure RADIUS Servers
   dialog box.
7. Click **+** under **External RADIUS Server** to add a RadSec server to the server group. The
   dialog box expands to display a **New External RADIUS Server** section.

8. Enter the **Name**, such as `primary_radsec`.

9. Click **+** next to **IP/Host Name**.

10. Select **IP Address**. The **New IP Address or Host Name** dialog box appears.

11. Enter the object **Name**, such as `Primary`.

12. Enter the RadSecProxy server address (the local IP address or hostname of your RadSecProxy
    instance) with port `1812` for authentication in **IP Address/Port**. For example:
    `192.168.1.100:1812`

13. Click **Save IP Object** on the bottom right. You return to the New External RADIUS Server
    section. You see the name of the object you created in the IP/Host Name field.

<figure className="screensnippet-wrapper">
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl('img/mobile-data-only/extreme/extreme-configureradius.png')}
    style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }}
    className="add-border-radius add-shadow add-shadow-margin"
  />
</figure>
<br />

14. Enter the **Shared Secret** as `mysecret` (the default secret configured in the RadSecProxy
    container).

15. Click **Save External RADIUS** on the bottom right. You return to the Configure RADIUS Servers
    page where you see the server you added (`primary_radsec`).

16. Check the box next to the server you added. This indicates you want to add it to the server
    group.

17. Click **Save RADIUS** on the bottom right to save your RadSec configuration. You return to the
    **Authenticate via RADIUS Server** section of the Wireless Networks page. You see the RadSec
    server group and server you created.

18. Click **Save** on the bottom right to save your network policy configuration. You return to the
    Wireless Networks page where you see the SSID you created.

### Assign the SSID to the Network Policy

1. Still on the **Wireless Networks** page, select the SSID by clicking the checkbox next to
   `Helium`.
2. Click **Next** on the bottom right. Clicking Next assigns the selected SSID to the network
   policy.

The network policy configuration is complete.

## Configure Hotspot 2.0

Hotspot 2.0 allows mobile devices to join a WiFi network automatically via Passpoint when the
devices enter the Hotspot 2.0 area.

You'll use the supplemental CLI option to configure Hotspot 2.0. When you enable supplemental CLI,
you enter the commands into the GUI. For that reason, we recommend composing the commands in a text
file beforehand so you have them ready when enabling the supplemental CLI.

### Compose Your CLI

Create a text file with the commands that link your network policy to Hotspot 2.0.

1. Create a hotspot profile with a profile name `Helium-profile`, an ANQP domain ID, and a network
   type.
   - `anqp-domain-id` default is `0`, which means the ANQP information is unique to this access
     point.
   - A network type of `2` indicates a Chargeable Public Network.

```
   hotspot profile Helium-profile
   hotspot profile Helium-profile anqp-domain-id 0
   hotspot profile Helium-profile network-type 2 access-internet
```

2. Configure the operator name `Helium-Operator` and the language (English).

```
   hotspot profile Helium-profile operator-name Helium-Operator language-code eng
```

3. Configure the hotspot to support IPv4 with double NATed private IPv4 address (`ip-type ipv4 2`).
   `ipv6 0` indicates that IPv6 is not available.

```
   hotspot profile Helium-profile ip-type ipv4 2 ipv6 0
```

4. Configure the domain names for Helium Passpoint. Add both required domains:

```
   hotspot profile Helium-profile domain-name freedomfi.com
   hotspot profile Helium-profile domain-name hellohelium.com
```

5. Create the NAI-realms for Helium Passpoint by specifying these parameters:
   - **Encoding type** — `0` (the default)
   - **EAP method** — `13` for EAP-TLS
   - **Sub-method** — Certificate

```
   hotspot profile Helium-profile nai-realm freedomfi.com encoding-type 0
   hotspot profile Helium-profile nai-realm freedomfi.com eap-method 13
   hotspot profile Helium-profile nai-realm hellohelium.com encoding-type 0
   hotspot profile Helium-profile nai-realm hellohelium.com eap-method 13
```

6. Configure the Helium SSID to use WPA3-AES 802.1X authentication.

```
   security-object Helium security protocol-suite wpa3-aes-8021x
```

7. Apply the `Helium-profile` hotspot profile to the Helium SSID.

```
   ssid Helium hotspot-profile Helium-profile
```

8. Save the configuration.

```
   save configuration
```
